		<br>My name is Ashli Green. I am second year student at the Univeristy of Georgia. 
		I am currently an Intended Business Management and International Business Major.
		I also plan on earning a Certificate in Music Business and a Minor in German.

	<h2>Background Info</h2>
	<p>
		I was born in Tupelo, MS on July 31,1997. My father served in the US Army and I
		spent most of my childhood overseas. I lived in Germany from 2001-2011. I started high 
		school in Augusta, GA at Lucy C Laney High School. In high school I participated in several
		after school activities. For example, I participated in Student Council. I also played soccer
		and was in the marching band. I graduated from Lucy C Laney as valedictorian of my class.
	</p>
	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<p>
		I have quite a few hobbies. Some of which include playing music, traveling, art, makeup,
		and reading. I started playing the alto saxophone in 9th grade and this is the main instrument
		that I play. I have also learned how to play the keyboard but I am still a beginner and I am 
		currently learning how to play the tuba. I enjoy watching Youtube videos of college bands and their
		dance teams. My absolute favorite college band is the Human Jukebox from Southern University<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVdvYyQWpN0>video</a>. 
		Some of my other favorite bands are the Sonic Boom of the South from Jackson State University and 
		the Sounds of Dyn-O-mite from Alcorn State University. I also enjoy watching videos on Youtube about 
		art and makeup. I would conisder myself a beginner in both of these areas but there are a lot of helpful 
		videos on Youtube. I also really enjoy traveling. I have been visited the majority of the countries in Europe.
		I enjoy being able to experince other cultures, see new sites, and try new foods. Next I hope to continue 
		to travel the US and then travel the Carribean, Asia, and South America.
